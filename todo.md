# To do

+ strategy for sandbox - portal with a SSO, CILogon or other secure access, from there, access Gradio interface, ComfyUI interface to other tools.
+ implement AudioGen via Gradio, ComfyUI, or both?
+ documentation for students and faculty
+ documentation for maintainers
+ BOX integration?
+ can we apply Ryan's LLAMA>Google sheet integration top txt2img?
+ how do we share that sheet as a template?
+ how do we store the sheet in user/BOX?
+ do we pass images to a user/BOX/subDir, or can they live in the google sheet?
+ capture the prompt, other variables, and the output in a single sheet.
+ copy google sheet as template; copy first sheet, so document can have related projects divided up by sheets
+ create a bestiary of GPUs for comparison
